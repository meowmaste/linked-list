## Deduplicate a linked list
----

This application builds a doubly-linked list of 200 nodes with random values between 1 and 100. It will remove any duplicate nodes so each value is in the list no more than one time. 

#### And example with values less than 10: 

Input:

      8 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 4 <=> 9 <=> 4 <=> 8 <=> 8 <=> 0 <=> 3

Output:

      8 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 9 <=> 0 <=> 3
